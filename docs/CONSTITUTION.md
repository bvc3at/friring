# Constitution

Non-negotiable rules that define what Friring **must** always be.
Each principle has an automated enforcement mechanism
— if it can't be enforced, it doesn't belong here.

## Principles

### 1. Crash-free operation

Errors are displayed in the UI (status bar / footer), never via panics.
The only panic path is the emergency terminal-restore hook in `main.rs`,
which exists to leave the user's terminal in a usable state
if something truly unexpected happens.

### 2. Module isolation

Domain dependency flow is one-directional:

```text
session  (no project-local imports)
agent    → session
ui       → session, app (read-only model/view state)
app      → session, agent, ui
```

`agent` and `ui` never import each other. This keeps the side-effect
layer (PTY management) completely decoupled from the rendering layer.
`ui → app` is the TEA `view(model)` coupling: the view renders state
types owned by `app` but never triggers side effects (and never
touches `agent` or `git`). The full per-module allowlist — including
utility modules — lives in `tests/architecture_rules.rs`; a new
`src/` module fails the test until its dependencies are declared
there.

### 3. Zero-warning policy

Both `clippy` and `rustdoc` run with warnings promoted to errors.
`rumdl` enforces markdown style (100-char line width, consistent
formatting). If any linter reports warnings, CI fails.

### 4. Permissive licenses only

All dependencies must carry licenses from the allowlist in `deny.toml`.
Copyleft crates are rejected at PR time.

### 5. Zero known vulnerabilities

`cargo-deny` advisories blocks merges
when known CVEs affect the dependency tree.

### 6. Conventional commits

Every commit message is validated against the Conventional Commits spec
by `cocogitto`. Non-conforming commits are rejected
by the `commit-msg` hook.

### 7. TEA as the single architectural pattern

The Elm Architecture (`Event -> Message -> update -> view -> Frame`)
is the only sanctioned control-flow pattern.
No ad-hoc event handlers, no component-local state, no callback chains.

### 8. Backend-first session model

Coding-agent sessions run via a `SessionBackend` trait, backed by
local tmux (`tmux -L friring`). tmux provides truly persistent
sessions that survive crashes/restarts.
We never mock, emulate, or screen-scrape a fake terminal.
The backend is the source of truth for session lifecycle.

### 9. Logging never touches stdout

Stdout belongs to the TUI. All diagnostic output goes to the log file
at `~/.local/share/friring/friring.log`.

### 10. Test-driven development (Red, Green, Refactor)

All features and bug fixes follow the TDD/BDD cycle:

1. **Red** — Write a failing test that defines the expected behavior.
2. **Green** — Write the minimum code to make the test pass.
3. **Refactor** — Clean up while keeping tests green.

Tests are written *before* or *alongside* the implementation,
never as an afterthought. If a bug is reported,
the fix starts with a test that reproduces it.

### 11. Deterministic CI — scripts over LLMs

CI pipelines must be reproducible and deterministic. Every check is a
script or tool that produces the same result given the same input.
LLM-generated judgments (code review bots, AI-powered linters)
are never gating — they may advise, but deterministic tools
(`clippy`, `nextest`, `cargo-deny`, `cog`, `rumdl`, `shellcheck`)
make the pass/fail decision.
Changes to CI configuration require careful review
because a broken pipeline affects every contributor.

### 12. Tag-based versioning

Version numbers are determined by git tags, not Cargo.toml.
The release workflow analyzes conventional commits, creates tags automatically,
and builds binaries with versions injected at build time.
No version bump commits pollute the git history.

**Why:** Automated version commits add noise without value. Tags are the
natural place for release markers. Build-time version detection ensures
binaries have correct versions while keeping the source tree clean.

**Mechanism:**

1. Release workflow (`release.yml`) analyzes commits via `cog bump --auto --dry-run`
2. Workflow creates lightweight tag (v{version}) and passes version via environment variable
3. `build.rs` reads `FRIRING_RELEASE_VERSION` and injects into binary
4. Cargo.toml version remains `0.0.0-dev` (development marker only)

**Result:**

- Release builds: version from tag (e.g., 0.1.0)
- Development builds: version from Cargo.toml (0.0.0-dev)

## Enforcement Map

| Principle | Enforced by | Config file |
|---|---|---|
| Crash-free operation | Code review + `#[deny(clippy::unwrap_used)]` (planned) | `clippy.toml` |
| Module isolation | `tests/architecture_rules.rs` | — |
| Zero warnings | `clippy -D warnings` + `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings"` + `rumdl` | CI + pre-commit |
| Permissive licenses | `cargo-deny check bans licenses` | `deny.toml` |
| Zero vulnerabilities | `cargo-deny check advisories` | `deny.toml` |
| Conventional commits | `cocogitto` (`cog verify`) | `cog.toml` |
| TEA pattern | `tests/architecture_rules.rs` + code review | — |
| Backend-first model | Code review | — |
| Logging off stdout | Code review | — |
| TDD (Red/Green/Refactor) | `cargo-nextest` + code review | `.config/nextest.toml` |
| Deterministic CI | Scripts and tools only; no LLM-gated checks | CI config + pre-commit |
| Tag-based versioning | `build.rs` + `release.yml` | `build.rs` + `.github/workflows/release.yml` |
