//! Remote provisioning of per-agent hook configs, so **every** agent — not
//! just claude — reports hooks-driven session status from a remote (SSH/WSL)
//! host.
//!
//! Locally the built-in hooks extension wires most agents through files in the
//! agent's *own* config dir (`~/.codex/hooks.json`, the opencode plugin, …).
//! Those files never travel with the launch args, so before this module a
//! remote codex/opencode/… session was silently Idle-only. At spawn time this
//! module ships the same payloads to the host — with their commands rewritten
//! to the tmux pane-option form (`builtin_hooks::rewrite_hook_signals_for_target`)
//! so the local TUI receives state over its control-mode subscription — using
//! the same safety rules as the local installer: `requires_dir` probe (skip
//! when the agent isn't installed there), deep-merge-not-clobber for shared
//! config files, managed-marker guard for standalone files, and
//! compare-before-write idempotency.
//!
//! **Best-effort by contract**: a down host, a permission error, or a
//! malformed remote file degrades to a warning (surfaced on the session as
//! `hook_wiring`) — it never fails the spawn.
//!
//! **Remote cleanup is deliberately out of scope** (friring never uninstalls
//! anything from a host — same policy as remote worktrees). The shipped
//! entries carry two prune markers (`friring-cli session signal` pre-rewrite,
//! `@friring_state` post-rewrite), so a future remote prune needs no schema
//! knowledge.
//!
//! Besides provisioning (the write side), this module also owns the
//! **headless status poll** (`poll_remote_hook_states`) — the read side that
//! keeps remote hook states flowing while no TUI is attached.
