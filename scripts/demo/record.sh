# Regenerate ALL Friring demo media in one pass, using REAL coding-agent CLIs.
#
# This single script records every video pair under docs/media/:
#
#   * friring-demo.{gif,mp4}            (agents.tape          — the hero demo)
#   * friring-file-manager.{gif,mp4}    (file-manager.tape)
#   * friring-info-panel.{gif,mp4}      (info-panel.tape)

# Every clip drives the actual `claude`, `opencode`, `codex` and `antigravity` CLIs —
# one per friring session — to showcase real multi-agent orchestration. No prompt
# is sent to any agent; they are launched and left on their start screens.
#
# Isolation (so this never touches your real friring, tmux, or agent accounts):
#   * HOME points at a throwaway dir  -> agents boot with NO chat history (no past
#     conversations leak into the video). To avoid login/trust dialogs on screen,
#     each CLI's auth *token* is copied into the throwaway HOME and every demo repo
#     is marked trusted (see "Seed agent credentials + pre-trust" below). Only the
#     token is copied, never history; auth files absent for a CLI you are not
#     logged into are simply skipped. No account email/handle is shown on screen:
#     codex surfaces no identity when logged in; antigravity (agy) and claude are
#     both featured LOGGED OUT on purpose, because each prints your account email
#     in its welcome box when signed in (agy fetches it from the server via its
#     keyring auth; claude prints the org name) — see their notes below.
#   * TMUX_TMPDIR points at a throwaway dir -> the `friring-dev` tmux server lives
#     in its own socket directory, so cleanup can't kill dev sessions you already
#     have running.
#   * XDG_{DATA,CONFIG,STATE,CACHE}_HOME point at a throwaway dir.
#
# Requirements: cargo, git, tmux, sqlite3, jq, vhs (+ ffmpeg + ttyd) and whichever agent CLIs
# you want to feature (claude / opencode / codex / antigravity). Missing agents are
# skipped with a warning.

# with a plain Ctrl+X. Because Ctrl+X is in terminal_passthrough (the emacs
# prefix key), those tapes open the review from the session list, not a focused
# terminal, where the chord would be forwarded to the agent instead.
