# Tests for the worker-session matching in flow-snapshot.sh / flow-summary.sh.
# Worker sessions are named "<title> · #<id>" (current) or "task-<id>[-…]"
# (legacy); both scripts must list them and tag them with their task #<id> for
# the **human board** (routing now goes through `message reply <id>`, which
# friring resolves — these scripts no longer drive it). A stub `friring-cli` on
# PATH feeds canned `session list` / `task list` JSON, so these run anywhere
# bats + jq are installed.
